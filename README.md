# sales-dashboard

This app was designed and developed as part of a coding assignment for SalesForce.com. It has been bootstrapped with <code>create-lwc-app</code>

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/client/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.
